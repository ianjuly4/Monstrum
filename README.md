# 🧸 Monstrum: The Cursed Hero

*A serious tale... told through the eyes of cuddly sprites with oversized weapons.*

## 🎮 What Is This?

**Monstrum: The Cursed Hero** is a combat-focused side-scrolling platformer built with **Phaser** and **Vite**. Inspired by classic beat-em-ups like *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles* and infused with the irony of cute, chonky characters in an otherwise "serious" world of monster hunting.

You play as a legendary monster slayer—transformed into the very thing he swore to destroy. To regain his humanity, he must defeat six cursed bosses and reclaim the shattered pieces of his heart.

There are two modes:
- **Storyline Mode** – Fight through a cursed saga to recover your humanity.
- **Battlegrounds Mode** – Hop in for quick, fun fights with no strings attached.

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

- **Phaser 3.90** – For pixel-perfect combat and animations.
- **Vite** – Lightning-fast dev environment and bundler.
- **Python** (optional, planned) – For save/load game support.
- **Port** – `localhost:8080` (default setup)

## 🧙‍♂️ Playable Characters

- **Titan Knight** – Sword-swinging, up-close bruiser.
- **Arcane Mage** – Master of mid-range elemental chaos.
- **Crossbow Assassin** – Agile and sneaky with ranged precision.

Each character has unique animations, special abilities, and a cursed lore path.

## 🖼️ Visual Style

- **Parallax scrolling** backgrounds for both story and battle scenes.
- **Cute yet deadly** art direction: Think snuggly warriors with oversized swords and dramatic effects.
- Platformer mechanics take a back seat to **tight, stylish combat** inspired by arcade classics.
